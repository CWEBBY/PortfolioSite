 * File: ~/index.html
 * Author: CWebb
 * Description: 
 * In it's 'reborn' revision, CSS, HTML and JS have all been reworked to their best so far. 
 * With async download, organised shader compile and even a naive implementation of a custom include system for the GL akin to HLSL's .cginc.
 * Basically a rewrite of the rendering system almost like an engine's system.
 * Seriously proud of this, given that it's a site done in an IDE.

					<h3>Hi there, I'm Chris.</h3>
					<p>I'm an 'all-round' junior software designer/developer that has just finished relocating to Melbourne, Australia.</p>
					<p>First and foremost, I'm a 'nuts-and-bolts' kind of person. If I can do it, chances are it's because I've done it before, pulled it apart, put it back together and pulled it apart again.</p>
					<p>This 'build-and-rebuild' approach I've taken with learning is, partly, due to my fondness of automotive modification. Anyone in that world can tell you that experience, knowledge and wisdom come from knowing every nut and bolt, what it's job is and how it does said job, and there is no substitute for 'getting your hands dirty'.</p>
					<p>Translating this into my time as a software developer, particularly one that has been gaming in their spare time from a young age, I tend to find fun things and dive deeply into them, understanding as much as I can on the topic. I've done this both in my time at the University of Newcastle but particularly in my 'after hours' learning where many late nights were had with weird and prototypical experiments with interesting lessons learned... and a lot of coffee.</p>
					<p>Basically, with any chance I've gotten to explore the world of software development, particularly in games development, I've taken it as a chance to sharpen not only my usefulness on a team but also for my own curiosity.</p>
					<h3>My official education includes:</h3>
					<ul class="qualifications">
						<li>Master of Information Technology, 2019<br>University of Newcastle - Callaghan, NSW</li>
						<li>Bachelor of Information Technology, 2017<br>University of Newcastle - Callaghan, NSW

						<h3>Midnight Pass</h3>
						<h4>An episodic, online, pixel art mobile project about street racing culture.</h4>
						<div class="thumbs">

						</div>
						<p>I've always been a fan of the <a target="_blank" href="https://wanganmaxi-official.com/wanganmaxi5/en/">'Wangan Midnight'</a> franchise, I also played drag racing games on mobile previously and found them lacking in some area or another (not bad, just lacking). This, and my 'nuts-and-bolts' approach, inspired the development of Midnight Pass. While my previous style of development has been useful for the exploration of skills, it is not a directional approach. The ‘street racer' genre of games is something that I have enjoyed before and look to add to with Midnight Pass.</p>
						<p>On the design side, I found the feeling of driving my own car (with a manual transmission) highly enticing as, famously, there is a directly connected interface with the mechanics of the car and ‘the feel’ of the driving. However, there is still a need for accessibility. As well as this, while I'm part of a crossover, a sizeable audience of gamers are not car enthusiasts, and so 'engaging' has several definitions. Managing and appealing to these different definitions means, to me, creating an experience that translates the authentic experience into an authentic feeling, allowing for authentic engagement. To me, this is the key to 'fun'. It was crucial that the game captures these aspects where many other games of this nature fail (in my opinion).</p>
						<p>Technically speaking, the game’s update model will use a custom CDN using <a target="_blank" href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> and Unity's Asset Bundle system and Firebase’s file hosting. Multiplayer, due to a ‘limitation’ of Firebase being that it is ‘non-real-time’ multiplayer, will be a <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST API</a> using Firebase’s Realtime Database, Firestore, Cloud Functions and Storage features. For example, multiplayer replays will be serialised via a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern#:~:text=In%20object%2Doriented%20programming%2C%20the,event%20at%20a%20later%20time.&text=Four%20terms%20always%20associated%20with,%2C%20receiver%2C%20invoker%20and%20client.">command pattern</a> and played back on opponent devices. This allows for a decoupling between the logic of the game and the input of the game. As mentioned, there is a directional approach to development, so various elements of development will be as platform-agnostic as possible, utilising the .NET framework and C# where possible, mostly using Unity for rendering, while still writing neat, segmented, separate components for object composition. As an aside, I'm also looking into testing functionality of these platforms, as I've noticed <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test driven design</a> as a trend in the industry recently. Lastly, knowing a bit about real-time ray tracing, I'm interested in, if just for the novelty, looking to create a relatively interesting rendering experience.</p>
						<p>While there's currently no live version on Midnight Pass, I have a Notion board that I use for daily development, it contains active tasks and notes I have on the process. Or, alternatively, reach out to me in private as I'm more than happy to answer any questions or just discuss it more.</p>

						<p>During the development of another project, I made the decision to port its progression to Unity. While becoming familiar with Unity, this happened.</p>
						<p>I thought about how a game developer's first exploration of an engine is often a basic and simplistic remake of some sort - I figured Pong was a good idea. However, I didn't want to replicate the known and loved Pong as it is, so I chose a neon aesthetic, partly to test my own post-processing programming.</p>
						<p>While becoming familiar with Unity, I learned how the rendering system within it worked, and took the opportunity to implement my own custom version of <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.postprocessing@3.1/manual/index.html">Unity's Post-Processing stack</a> to see if I could. This became vital as the neon aesthetics' bloom and noise needed constant tweaking as it is reactive to gameplay - which is something that I believe is easier to do with my own implementation of post-processing over Unity's.</p>
						<p>That left design. I liked the idea of a game of Pong that constantly changed the aim and objective frantically and possibly even comically, so I decided to make it. To me, phone games can be a goldmine (by way of the whole 'limitations give way to innovations' thing), Neon Pong is a draft at such attempts. My <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">'Hello World'</a> on the matter, if you will.</p>
						<p>This was released on the Google Play Store (sorry Apple folks, I don't own anything Apple) if you want to give it a try. Pure, ad-free, in-game transaction-less Pong. I will mention that this was made in a day to familiarise myself with the Unity Editor. With time, I will go back to polish it, but as is, it is a rough prototype made to show that I can use Unity.</p>

						<h3>Project Marchmallow</h3>
						<h4>A barebones WebGL raymarching kit capable of some crazy looks.</h4>
						<div class="thumbs">
							<a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/webgl/"><img src="/resources/images/icons/mini/webgl.png"></a>
							<a target="_blank" href="https://www.javascript.com/"><img src="/resources/images/icons/mini/js.png"></a>
						</div>
						<p>Project Marchmallow is a cutely named project undertaken for this site specifically but flourished into a mini renderer for WebGL.</p>
						<p>I wrote it for this site after finding my original implementation lacking and found alternatives like THREE.js to be, in my opinion, too 'bloated' for my usecase.</p>
						<p>Specifically, I found that I wanted basic rendering capabilities without the need to control the madness that is the OpenGL state-machine manually, setting state line by line.</p>
						<p>Basically, with an API between THREE.js and Unity, but specialised for ray marching, Marchmallow allows for HLSL-ish GLSL with the likes of an '#include' system, allowing for the use of reusable libraries.</p>
						<p>It also has a built in post processing stack to get the best out of what it can do.</p>
						<p>It takes cues from modern rendering practices where it can (when WebGL v1 allows) and wraps them in ES6 style Javascript objects (classes).</p>
						<p>The repo is on Github for browsing, feel free to use it. Just be aware that it is for *ray marching* and as such, needs a bit of work to draw meshes as a rasteriser.</p>
						<p>This was a passion project that served a massive amount of education on how modern path tracing works.</p>

						<p>At the end of my Master's degree, I needed to work in a group to create a product. With myself being the only 'full on' developer, the engineering of the creation was at my discretion in terms of implementation.</p>
						<p>I elected to use the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture">3-layer N-Tier architecture system</a> to contain an SQL database and use NodeJS as a middle layer, with the rendered HTML (rendered via NodeJS's PugJS) being the presentation layer. I was asked what I wanted to take on, with AI being my answer. My group and I planned to replicate a real estate website that used AI to advise in the place of an agent, based off of user data and browsing habits.</p>
						<p>The way this worked was to note user behaviour, store it in SQL as keywords related to a user, then, when browsing, using a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system">'Netflix-style' recommender system</a>, wherein the behaviours were compared to the behaviours of other, more active, users in an effort to find suggestions that the user might not have found otherwise. Technically speaking, the 'AI' was nothing more than a dot product comparison of behaviours and with me already being familiar with the idea of a dot product comparison through my experimentation in rendering and games, the recommender was somewhat trivial to implement.</p>
						<p>While this project is not directly related to game development, I was required, as per the course material, to write a review of the existing literature on AI in a specific area (being video games). With 'AI' being state machines in games for decades, the advancements in AI have been dramatic in the industry and are mostly recent, meaning I wasn't reading papers from the 90s, instead, about studies and experiments with reinforcement, generative adversarial and deep learning intelligence.</p>
						<p>If you're a game developer and are looking to see how AI can either aid you with development or the functionality of a finished game, feel free to give it a read.</p>

						<p>HAWC or "Home Automation Wireless Control" was a student major project that I was a part of for my Bachelor degree in 2017.</p>
						<p>Much like other home automation systems, HAWC relies on client/server models in conjunction with relay technologies to power appliances.</p>
						<p>Specifically, a server running NodeJS communicates with the outside connections and triggers scripts on specified wireless relays. The full set of features allowed for users to securely log in and control their home from anywhere, while also allowing for timers and third-party plugins.</p>
						<p>My role was as one of two programmers involved, focusing more on the electrical engineering side of the project, while the other programmer initially created the server system's scripting. By the end however, we were both very adept with the full scope of the work.</p>
						<p>I do not own the full and finished code, nor do I take full credit for all the code, but it is available to look at on my Github repository for it, if you were curious.</p>

						<p>After watching <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/">Blade Runner</a> and its sequel, playing <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prey_(2017_video_game)">Prey (2017)</a>, seeing the trailer for the upcoming game <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4IPBiB7SF4">'The Last Night' at the 2017 E3 XBox conference</a>, and being a huge fan of games with interpretive meanings like <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotline_Miami">Hotline Miami</a>, I was inspired to make a 2D, side on, sprite-based, narratively driven game where your choices matter. I was starting a project for my final project at university and started from scratch in GameMaker Studio to build a game that was better mechanically, technically and narratively.</p>
						<p>Afterwards, given that GameMaker Studio's mostly a 2D engine, I moved to Unity and used it as a springboard for learning 3D lighting, physics and volumetric rendering. Does Unity do this 'out of the box', yes, but I learned it on my own as well, developing the rendering and VFX from the ground up using OpenGL for a stunning visual experience. Inheritance is for me, a learning experience project, not a production one, as such, there is no tangible release date. But be assured that anything cool that I do probably came from this.</p>

						<p>When I started to learn C-based languages, I was introduced to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> brand by my father. It was the first time I was aware of programmable circuit boards and the large scope of their applications. At about this time, the clock in my <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Mirage#1995">1990's Mitsubishi Lancer</a> started to fault. It sparked an idea.</p>
						<p>I decided to learn a bit of C++ on my own (at the time, I barely knew C#) and combine my skills in electrical engineering with those of programming to create a novelty application that, given the electrical components, added more functionality to a simple clock module. It wasn't much, but as an avid car enthusiast, it was one more step to making my car more unique and to my own taste.</p>

						<p>For those who did tertiary education, there would have been plenty of those assignments that one 'just didn't want to do'. This was one of them for me. I decided to jokingly jest at the pretentiousness associated with some of the stereotypes of coffee drinkers including the 'culture' of higher grandeur surrounding falsely premium consumer products.</p>
						<p>While I didn't feel it worthy of being in my portfolio, I felt it was noteworthy as it is the first occasion where <a target="_blank" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/">proper and modern design</a> was in my head from the moment creation started. Clear and elegant design needed to be evident in the visual aspect of the site as well as overall readability.</p>
						<h4>Just Text Me</h4>

						<p>One of my first attempts at game design, Just Text Me was a game on mobile that would emulate the Android messaging app and would give you contextual responses to people talking to you which would drive narrative in a 'choose your own adventure' way.</p>
						<p>I was inspired by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Is_Away">"Emily Is Away"</a> and ultimately decided to shelf the project when Telltale games published the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot#In_other_media">"Mr Robot"</a> mobile game which applied a similar concept to mobile but within the context of the Sam Esmail's television show of the same name, with my reason being that 'I appreciate that I cannot do better than this' at the time... the titular game was really well made.</p>
